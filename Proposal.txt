Idea One: QuizMe 

QuizMe is a study tool that allows users to test their knowledge of certain documents. How does it work? A user uploads a document to a website. Leveraging OpenAI's API, we generate questions for the user to answer. User's will be able to login, save documents, adjust the amount of questions generated, and choose types of questions asked.
