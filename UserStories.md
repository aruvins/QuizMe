1. The user would be able to input text and recieve 10 questions based on the text.
     When a user accesses the application, they would be greeted with a text box where they can input text that they want a quiz for. They would then click the submit button below that. The user would then recieve a page with the text shown again and 10 questions based on the text below that. If the user inputs no text then no questions will be generated. The program would then notify the user that there was no input. If the user inputs incomprehensible text they will be notified by the application that their input was incomprehensible to our language model.
     
2. The user would be able to highlight specific keywords and recieve a wikipedia article on the highlighted text.
    After recieving the page with the questions, they would be able to highlight specific words or phrases and see a white box above it containing the definition from wikipedia. If the user highlights a word or phrase that doesn't have a wikipedia article associated to it, nothing will be displayed. This is to prevent uneccessary articles to show up if the user were to highlight simple phrases.
    
3. The user would be able to create a profile.
    The user would have be able to click a sign up link where they can create a profile. The user would input their desired username and password, then they will click submit. If no username or password is being input the program would notify the user that a username or password must be present. 3rd party authentication will be present so the user would be able to sign up using a 3rd party account.
    
4. The user would be able to log in with username and password.
    The user would be able to return to the site and input their username and password and be able to access all of the data associated to their profile. If no username or password is being input the program would notify the user that a username or password must be present. 3rd party authentication will be present so the user would be able to log in using a 3rd party account.
    
5. As a logged in user, the user would be able save the questions.
    Once the user is finished creating a quiz, they would be able to click a save button and add it to a saved quizzes page. If the user clicks out of the page without saving, they would not be able to access that particular quiz again. The user would be able to click onto a tab and see previous quizzes that have been generated, given that they have clicked on the save button for those particular quizzes. If a user is not logged in, they would not be able to access any saved quizzes.
    
6. As a logged in user, the user be able to access previous quizzes at a later date.
    When the user is logged in they would be able to click onto a saved quizzes page and access their previously saved quizzes. If a user is not logged in, they would not be able to access any saved quizzes.

Changes as of April 30th: 

In the final stages of our project we decided to narrow the scope of certain things so we could focus on completing all requirements.
We decided to get rid of entity recognition. We felt as though highlighting for definitions was sufficient.
